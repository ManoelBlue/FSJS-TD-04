    OOP Game Show App
    Uses JavaScript to create a simple game for guessing a secret phrase.
    Uses CSS to create fun animations that also improve the user experience.

## CSS animations:
- add box shadows to the clicked keys and to the displayed letters;
- add a heart pump to the lost life heart;

### Additional info:
This project is the fourth part of a Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. Therefore, my personal work is in the js folder, plus the extra.css file (within the css folder). The other styles and the markup were provided.
